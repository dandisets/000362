description: "We tested the jGCaMP8 sensors in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of mouse primary
  visual cortex. We made a craniotomy over V1 and infected neurons with adeno-associated
  virus (AAV2/1-hSynapsin-1) encoding jGCaMP8 variants (s/m/f), jGCaMP7f, or XCaMP-Gf.
  18-80 days after the virus injection, the mouse was anesthetized, and we surgically
  removed the cranial window and performed durotomy. The craniotomy was filled with
  10-15 μL of 1.5% agarose, and a D-shaped coverslip was secured on top to suppress
  brain motion and leave access to the brain on the lateral side of the craniotomy.
  Then mice were lightly anesthetized and mounted under a custom two-photon microscope.
  Full-field, high-contrast drifting gratings were presented in each of eight directions
  to the contralateral eye. Two-photon imaging (122 Hz) was performed of L2/3 somata
  and neuropil combined with loose-seal, cell-attached electrophysiological recording
  of a single neuron in the field of view. \nThis dataset contains the raw 2-photon
  videos, for registered movies see: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000168/"
